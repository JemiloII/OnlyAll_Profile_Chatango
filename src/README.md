This is a profile for chatango. Although it may be designed to be mobile friendly, it is design for 960width 810height, the standard chatango window height in chrome. I'll mostlikely add javascript to force window to the size. This is for desktop view as chatango's main pm site is in flash. However I will note that chatango profiles use html, css. So this website will live in a iframe and will then be able to use javascript functionality.
